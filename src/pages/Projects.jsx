          <strong>Impact of Climate Change and Human Activities on Water Resources in HRB</strong>
          <span style={{float:'right'}}>Aug 2023 ‚Äì Aug 2025 <span style={{color:'red', fontStyle:'italic'}}>(Group Project)</span></span><br/>
          <em>Water Conflict, Hydrological Modeling, GRACE, Wavelet Analysis</em>
          <ul>
            <li>Investigates the impact of climate change and human activities on water storage in HRB using remote sensing data, hydrological modeling, and wavelet analysis.</li>
            <li>The Bayesian change point detection algorithm was applied, identifying 1998 as the significant change point.</li>
            <li>Climatic shift and human activities have resulted in 40 Gt water storage loss from the Helmand River basin over the last two decades.</li>
            <li>The wavelet analysis reveals that the over-exploitation of water storage led to persistent dry conditions in the post-change period, triggering a phase shift in evapotranspiration patterns.</li>

          <strong>Specific yield of groundwater systems declines exponentially with a water table</strong>
          <span style={{float:'right'}}>Aug 2023 ‚Äì Mar 2025 <span style={{color:'red', fontStyle:'italic'}}>(Group Project)</span></span><br/>
          <em>Satellite Gravimetry, Groundwater Level</em>
          <ul>
            <li>Using satellite gravimetry data and available in-situ well data, it is shown that specific yield is not constant and varies exponentially with groundwater levels.</li>
            <li>The best fit exponential function is found to be the same across the United States, Europe, Australia, China, and India, with small variations in the rate of decay.</li>
            <li>Most of the regions investigated have experienced a decline in specific yield over the last two decades and the amount of groundwater perceived to be available for some locations is 80% less than that estimated using constant specific yield.</li>

          <ul>

            <li>Predicted the streamflow at ungauged sub-basins using a well-calibrated SWAT model.</li>
            <li>Ensemble of SWAT and "abcd" models were developed to improve streamflow estimation, and long-term droughts were analyzed.</li>
